## Abstract

This project contains the training implementation with CIFAR-10 based on EfficientNet and Cutout. An integrational model is built with the idea of reinforced scaling and baseline. The best training result of the model is 87% accuracy.

Accuracy to parameters used of Baseline using fully connected layers:  
Best result: 50% Accuracy
